# GTD-Pad 3

A complete rebuild of my wiki/to-do list app, using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and making use of everything I've learned since building the last version.

I'm going to host this for my own use, but anyone will be able to sign up for an account. Alternatively, you can just grab the source code and set it up on your own serverâ€”or fork this repository and create your own version, modified to suit your needs.
